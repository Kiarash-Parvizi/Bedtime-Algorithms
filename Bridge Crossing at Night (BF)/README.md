# Problem description:

Bridge Crossing at Night A group of four people, who have one flashlight, need to
cross a rickety bridge at night. A maximum of two people can cross the bridge at one
time, and any party that crosses (either one or two people) must have the flashlight
with them. The flashlight must be walked back and forth; it cannot be thrown. Person
A takes 1 minute to cross the bridge, person B takes 2 minutes, person C takes 5
minutes, and person D takes 10 minutes. A pair must walk together at the rate of the
slower person’s pace. Find the fastest way they can accomplish this task.
